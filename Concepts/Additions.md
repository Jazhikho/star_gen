Additional Planet Types
Ice Giants — A distinct type from gas giants with different internal structure, methane-blue coloring, and less prominent banding (like Uranus/Neptune but as their own category)
Dwarf Planets / Asteroids — Irregular shapes, heavily cratered, no atmosphere
Ocean Worlds — Entirely water-covered like Europa or Enceladus, with subsurface crack patterns and ice shell features
Super-Earths — Scaled-up terrestrial with more extreme features, higher gravity effects on terrain
Carbon Planets — Theoretical planets with graphite/diamond surfaces, very different color palettes
Rogue Planets — No star illumination, only faint heat glow from within

Visual Features to Add
Craters — Impact craters with rays, especially for airless bodies
Volcanoes — Visible volcanic plumes or lava flows (like Io)
Cryovolcanism — Geysers for icy moons
Auroras — Polar light displays, especially visible on the night side
Lightning — Storm flashes in gas giant atmospheres or terrestrial clouds
Tectonic features — Visible fault lines, rift valleys, mountain ranges with directionality
Seasonal ice caps — Animate ice cap size based on a seasonal cycle
Day/night city lights — More detailed patterns following coastlines/terrain
Vegetation patterns — Biome-aware coloring that follows moisture/temperature gradients

Ring System Enhancements
Cassini Division-style gaps — Named/prominent gaps with specific positions
Shepherd moons — Tiny dots visible in ring gaps
Ring shadows on rings — Self-shadowing within the ring system
Braided/kinked rings — Like some of Neptune's rings
Dusty vs icy ring color — Different particle composition affecting appearance
Ring particle density visualization — Spokes or density waves

Moons & Companions
Orbiting moons — One or more small spheres orbiting the planet
Moon shadows — Transit shadows crossing the planet surface
Moon phases — Proper illumination on moons
Binary planets — Two similarly-sized bodies orbiting each other

Atmospheric Effects
Supersonic jet streams — Visible high-speed wind bands
Dust storms — Large regional opacity changes (like Mars)
Hazes — High-altitude haze layers with different colors
Crepuscular rays — Light shafts through cloud gaps at the terminator
Airglow — Faint night-side atmospheric emission

Stellar Environment
Multiple suns — Binary/trinary star lighting with colored shadows
Nearby nebula — More prominent background nebulae
Star type effects — Red dwarf (dim, red lighting), blue giant (harsh, blue)
Solar flares/prominences — If the star is visible at frame edge
Zodiacal light — Dust disk glow near the orbital plane

Technical/Interactive Improvements
Export/Import — Save planet configurations as JSON, share seeds
Screenshot button — High-res PNG export
Animation timeline — Record orbital/rotational sequences
Comparison view — Side-by-side two planets
Size reference — Optional Earth silhouette for scale
Orbital view — Zoom out to show the planet in its orbit
Surface landing zoom — Fractal zoom into terrain detail
Atmosphere cross-section — Diagram showing atmospheric layers
Spectrogram — Fake absorption spectrum based on atmosphere composition

Scientific Accuracy Additions
Realistic temperature calculation — Based on star distance, albedo, greenhouse
Habitability zone indicator — Show where planet sits relative to HZ
Atmospheric escape — Visual indication of atmospheric loss for small/hot planets
Tidal locking visualization — Permanent day/night hemispheres
Magnetic field lines — Optional overlay showing magnetosphere shape
Radiation belts — Van Allen belt visualization

UI/UX Improvements
Collapsible sections — Better organization for the many controls
Preset thumbnails — Visual preview of presets
Undo/redo — Step back through parameter changes
Randomize within bounds — "Make it more Earth-like" constrained randomization
Tooltips — Explain what each parameter does scientifically
Keyboard shortcuts — Quick access to common actions
