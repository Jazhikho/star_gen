### EditDialog (Phase 4 Preview - Deferred)

- **Title**: Object editing dialog (EditDialog.gd)
- **Why it matters**: First attempt at Phase 4 object editing functionality. Allows editing celestial body properties with validation, derived value recalculation, and preview.
- **Phase**: Phase 4 - Object editing v1 (currently deferred)
- **Complexity**: L (Large)
- **Status**: Files exist in `src/app/viewer/` but are NOT integrated or tracked. This was started as a preview/exploration of Phase 4 requirements. Keep the files for reference when revisiting Phase 4, but do not actively develop or integrate until Phase 4 becomes the active phase.
- **Files**: 
  - `src/app/viewer/EditDialog.gd`
  - `src/app/viewer/EditDialog.tscn`
  - `src/app/viewer/EditDialog.gd.uid`
