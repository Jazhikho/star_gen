## Stellar IMF / spectral distribution

| Title | Authors | Year | Link | Covers | Note |
|-------|---------|------|------|--------|------|
| Stellar Inventory of the Solar Neighborhood using Gaia DR1 | Bovy, J. | 2017 | [arXiv:1704.05063](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05063) | Gaia DR1 selection function; local number density and vertical profiles by spectral type (A through K, giants); high-mass present-day mass function dn/dM; total mid-plane stellar density 0.040±0.002 M☉/pc³; luminosity function. | **Reviewed.** Full text (abridged): [Texts/Bovy2017.txt](Texts/Bovy2017.txt). See AnnotatedBibliography (Stellar distribution; Solar neighborhood density). |
| Stellar Initial Mass Function Varies with Metallicities and Time | Li, J., Liu, C., Zhang, Z.-Y., Tian, H., Fu, X., Li, J., Yan, Z.-Q. | 2023 | [arXiv:2301.07029](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07029) | ~93,000 spectroscopically observed M dwarfs in 100–300 pc; variable IMF with metallicity and age; early populations have fewer low-mass stars; present-day proportion of low-mass stars increases with metallicity. | **Reviewed.** Full text (abridged): [Texts/Li2023.txt](Texts/Li2023.txt). See AnnotatedBibliography (Stellar distribution). |
| Probing the Milky Way stellar and brown dwarf initial mass function with modern microlensing observations | Chabrier, G., Lenoble, R. | 2023 | [arXiv:2301.05139](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05139) | Microlensing toward Galactic bulge; stellar+brown dwarf IMF consistent with Chabrier (2005) disk IMF; other IMFs overpredict very-low-mass objects; bulge center may be bottom-heavy. | Abstract only. ApJ Letters. Supports use of Chabrier-style IMF. |
| The Initial Mass Function Based on the Full-sky 20 pc Census of ∼3600 Stars and Brown Dwarfs | Kirkpatrick et al. | 2024 | [ApJS 271:55](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJS..271...55K/abstract) / [IOP](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ad24e2) | Volume-limited 20 pc census; Gaia + ground-based + Spitzer; quadripartite power-law IMF; M-dwarf and brown dwarf regime; star-to-brown-dwarf number ratio ~4:1. | Abstract only. Direct 20 pc census for IMF/spectral benchmarks. |
| The stellar initial mass function of the solar neighbourhood revealed by Gaia | (MNRAS) | — | [MNRAS 489:2377](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/489/2/2377/5561404) | Gaia-based stellar IMF in solar neighborhood. | Abstract only. Paywalled; find preprint or institutional access. |

Has [HTML (experimental)](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.06052v1) on arXiv. |
| Number Densities of Stars of Different Types in the Solar Vicinity | Mamajek, E. | — | [Rochester memo](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/memo_star_dens.html) | Summary of local number densities (~0.1 stars/pc³, M dwarfs ~78%); useful comparison to “per system” vs “per star” density. | Web memo; grab for context. |

|-------|---------|------|------|--------|------|
| On the Occurrence Rate of Hot Jupiters in Different Stellar Environments | Wang, J., Fischer, D. A., Horch, E. P., Huang, X. | 2015 | [arXiv:1412.1731](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1731) | California Planet Survey vs Kepler; HJ occurrence differs by factor of two; 12.8%±0.24% of HJs misidentified in Kepler (dilution, subgiant contamination); fundamental HJ rate by multiplicity and evolutionary stage. | Abstract only.

## Orbital stability (planet spacing)

| Title | Authors | Year | Link | Covers | Note |
|-------|---------|------|------|--------|------|
| The Stability of Multi-Planet Systems | Chambers, J. E., Wetherill, G. W., Boss, A. P. | 1996 | [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996Icar..119..261C/abstract) / [DOI 10.1006/icar.1996.0019](https://doi.org/10.1006/icar.1996.0019) | Two planets: stable if Δ (in mutual Hill radii R_H) exceeds critical value. Multi-planet: systems with Δ &lt; 10 always unstable (log t ≈ bΔ + c); likely unstable for Δ &gt; 10 on longer timescales. Slope b weakly depends on planet count; mass scaling. | Abstract only. Icarus 119:261–268. **Primary source for ~10 R_H rule in StarGen.** |

## Adding full-text copies

After you obtain a PDF (or HTML), extract plain text (e.g. `pdftotext paper.pdf`) and save as `Sources/Texts/AuthorYear.txt` (e.g. `Chambers1996.txt`, `Bovy2017.txt`). Then add or update the corresponding entry in [AnnotatedBibliography.md](AnnotatedBibliography.md) with the full citation and “Used in” locations.
